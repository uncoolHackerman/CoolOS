stage2.c isn't really bothered about syntax at the moment. It only checks for a semi-colon at the end of the option it's viewing and a colon at the start
option format is :OPTION=option;
DO NOT use :OPTION = option;
any string which isn't an option name is a comment

let stage2 know the config file is in the right format
